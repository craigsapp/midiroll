Stanford Digitized Piano Rolls
==============================

This directory contains two subdirectories:

(1) scandata
(2) dynamics

`scandata` contains MIDI files which are minimally processed information
about holes from a piano-roll scan.  Each tick represents one row in
the pixel image.

`dynamics` contains MIDI files which model note attacks from the
expression holes on the roll.

File names are based on DRUID (Digitial Repository Unique IDentifier) which 
references a specific scan in SDR (Stanford Digital Repository) of the 
Stanford Libraries.
